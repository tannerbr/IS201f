                                January 2022 to August 2022
                                During my time at VASA, I was a member experience specialist or MES, my tasks were to help members enjoy their experience at VASA and help sign new members up for memberships. I also dealt with calls from members who were experiencing problems and worked with them to solutions to their problems. I also made sure the gym was clean and regularly picked up weights and equipment off the floor and took out trash and other tasks related maintaining the gym so that members could have the best experience possible.

                                April 2021 to January 2022
                                My time at Smash it Supplements has been similar to working at GNC. I am responsible for informing and selling the fitness supplements to the customers that come in looking to enhance their workout using the supplements we provide. I usually close in the evenings and am responsible for counting the till and cleaning at the end of the day making sure the store is ready for the morning.

                                January 2021 to April 2021
                                During my time as an employee at GNC I was primarily responsible with helping the store reach its sales goals. Doing this included promoting the stores brand and other big-name products, selling loyalty memberships, and helping customers by giving them the knowledge and advice they needed to have a satisfactory experience while shopping at GNC. I would also count the stores inventory to make sure that products were up to date and accounted for to avoid or make note of any loss of product.
